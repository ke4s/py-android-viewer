# py android viewer

This package allows you to get video stream from the android device.

Stream frames already converted to numpy array using [PyAV](https://github.com/mikeboers/PyAV)

Also this package allows you to send touch events to devices.


### How it works
I am using [scrcpy](https://github.com/Genymobile/scrcpy) server and connect to two sockets, video and control sockets.
Video stream has almost no delay because I am not using separate process of `ffmpeg` and use direct bindings to `ffmpeg` to decode video.

Check class and class method arguments for more details.

### Requirements 
Python Package [PyAV](http://docs.mikeboers.com/pyav/develop/overview/installation.html)

Installed [ffmpeg](http://ffmpeg.org/)

And installed [ADB](https://developer.android.com/tools/adb) on your system.  

On macos
```bash
    brew install ffmpeg@7.0.2 
    brew install pkg-config@0.29.2
    pip install -r requriements.txt 
    pip install av==13.0.0 --no-binary av
```

Default ADB path is set to `/usr/local/bin/adb` but it might be different on your system.
You can change it by providing `adb_path` argument to AndroidViewer constructor.

### Examples
```python
import cv2
from viewer import AndroidViewer

# This will deploy and run server on android device connected to USB
android = AndroidViewer(adb_path='/usr/local/bin/adb')

while True:
    frames = android.get_next_frames()
    if frames is None:
        continue
    
    for frame in frames:
        cv2.imshow('game', frame)
        cv2.waitKey(1)
```

Send swipe event:
```python
    android = AndroidViewer()
    android.swipe(start_x, start_y, end_x, end_y)   
```
